Project title: [Brainy Grid ]

Project page: [https://github.com/SinovuyoMkayo/Sudoku-game.git]

Instructions for use (allowable actions): [How to interact with the Brainy Grid game.

To interact with the Brainy Grid game you will have to follow the subsequent steps.

Step 1: To Start the Game: Click on the Brainy Grid app on mobile device.

Step 2: Select a Difficulty Level: There are several levels of difficulty for the Brainy Grid game, from easy to hard. Pick a level of difficulty that corresponds to your ability or preference.

Step 3: Start a New Game: Choose the "Start a new game" option to play a new game. The app will then produce a randomly generated puzzle for you.

Step 4: Entering Numbers: You must enter numbers onto a grid in order to complete the puzzle. Normally, you can pick a cell by clicking or tapping on it, then input the number you want to enter into that cell.

Step 5: Check for Errors: Our game has error-checking tools that can draw attention to wrong numbers in the grid. There will be a limit of three attempts, and these elements can assist you in recognizing and correcting errors as you work through the puzzle. When you believe you have completed the puzzle correctly and have filled in all the numbers, check to see if there are any errors.
Step 6: Finishing the Puzzle: Until the puzzle is finished, keep adding numbers and following the game's rules (each row, column, and 3x3 box should include the numbers 1 through 9 without repetitions).
Step 7: Start a New Puzzle: By using the same steps, you can continue solving problems or begin a new one.

Step 8: Explore Additional Features: Our game includes an additional feature such as a timer that will count the number of minutes you spent in completing the level.

Step 9: Exit or Close the Program: When you're done playing Sudoku, exit the program.

Tools used: [Swing/AWT,IDE(eclips), GUI, JavaFX, VCS]

Concepts used: [2D Array(is used to create the puzzle grids), Random Numbers(are used to fill in the numbers in the grid), Boolean(used to check the repeatition of numbers in the cells(column and rows)), The main class, The SudokuGrid class]

Assumptions: [Code Buddies assume that this system should be used or ran by following the steps below:
step 1: onto your mobile device click onto the Brainy grid application
step 2: select the level of difficulty and the game should thereafter start poping up the grids, some with numbers and without numbers
step 3: after you have finished filling in numbers it should give you feedback on how much time spent in completing the grids. if you still want to contineu you should indicate by pressing "next level", else click "exit"]

Limitations: [Our game is limeted on three types of difficulty in which are level 1,2 and 3. Which means if you are able to complete level 3 then you are the "Master" of the game (Brainy Grids)State. The second thing that our game cannot do is to save the current level you are in if it happens that the you decides to exit the game without completing the current level.]
